== Support

This section defines the GraalVM version, languages and dependencies that have been validated against Spring Native {version},
which provides beta support on the scope defined in this section. You can try it on your projects if they are using those
supported dependencies, and https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-native/issues[raise bugs] or
https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-native/pulls[contribute pull requests] if something goes wrong.

Beta support also means that breaking changes will happen, but a migration path will be provided and documented.

[[support-graalvm]]
=== GraalVM

GraalVM version {graalvm-version} is supported, see the related https://www.graalvm.org/release-notes/[release notes].
GraalVM issues impacting the Spring ecosystem are identified on their issue tracker using https://github.com/oracle/graal/labels/spring[the `spring` label].

[[support-language]]
=== Language

Java 11, and Kotlin 1.5+ are supported.

Kotlin Coroutines are supported but require additional reflection entries due to how Coroutines generates bytecode with an `Object` return type.

[[support-tooling]]
=== Tooling

Maven and Gradle (version 7 or above) are supported.

[[support-feature-flags]]
=== Feature flags

Some features like HTTPS may require some additional flags, check <<native-image-options>> for more details.
When it recognizes certain usage scenarios, Spring Native tries to set required flags automatically.

[[support-spring-boot]]
=== Spring Boot

IMPORTANT: Spring Native {version} is designed to be used with Spring Boot {spring-boot-version}. A new release of Spring Native will happen for each patch release of the latest Spring Boot 2.x minor version in order to ensure support and compatibility.

The following starters are supported, the group ID is `org.springframework.boot` unless specified otherwise.

* `spring-boot-starter-actuator`: WebMvc and WebFlux are supported, as well as metrics and tracing infrastructure.
Beware that actuators significantly increase the footprint, this will be optimized in a future release.
* `spring-boot-starter-data-elasticsearch`
* `spring-boot-starter-data-jdbc`
* `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`
** You need to configure https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.4/topical/html_single/bytecode/BytecodeEnhancement.html#_build_time_enhancement[Hibernate build-time bytecode enhancement]
** `hibernate.bytecode.provider=none` is automatically set
* `spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb`
* `spring-boot-starter-data-neo4j`
* `spring-boot-starter-data-r2dbc`
* `spring-boot-starter-data-redis`
* `spring-boot-starter-hateoas`
* `spring-boot-starter-jdbc`
* `spring-boot-starter-logging`
** Logback is supported, but https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-native/issues/625[not configuration with `logback.xml`] so please configure it with `application.properties` or `application.yml` for now, or use <<logback-workaround, this workaround>> to configure it programmatically.
** Log4j2 is not supported yet, see https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-native/issues/115[#115].
* `spring-boot-starter-mail`
* `spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf`
* `spring-boot-starter-rsocket`
* `spring-boot-starter-validation`
* `spring-boot-starter-security`: WebMvc and WebFlux form login, HTTP basic authentication, OAuth 2.0 and LDAP are supported.
RSocket security is also supported.
* `spring-boot-starter-oauth2-resource-server`: WebMvc and WebFlux are supported.
* `spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client`: WebMvc and WebFlux are supported.
* `spring-boot-starter-webflux`:
** For Web support, only Reactor Netty is supported for now.
** For WebSocket support, Tomcat, Jetty 9, Undertow and Reactor Netty are supported. Jetty 10 is not supported.
* `spring-boot-starter-web`:
** Only Tomcat is supported for now.
** `--enable-https` flag is required for HTTPS support.
** `org.apache.tomcat.experimental:tomcat-embed-programmatic` dependency can be used instead of `tomcat-embed-core` and `tomcat-embed-websocket` ones for optimized footprint.
* `spring-boot-starter-websocket`
* `com.wavefront:wavefront-spring-boot-starter`
* `spring-boot-starter-quartz`: supports the http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/[Quartz Job Scheduling] engine. It adds types required by Quartz, and automatically registers any `Job` subclasses for reflection.

WARNING: Spring Integration and testing are not supported in this version.

[[support-spring-cloud]]
=== Spring Cloud

IMPORTANT: Spring Native {version} is designed to be used with Spring Cloud {spring-cloud-version}.

Group ID is `org.springframework.cloud`.

NOTE: When using Spring Native, `spring.cloud.refresh.enabled` is set to `false` for compatibility and footprint reasons. `spring.sleuth.async.enabled` is also set to `false` since this feature leads to too much proxies created for a reasonable footprint.

* `spring-cloud-starter-config`
* `spring-cloud-config-client`
* `spring-cloud-config-server`
* `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client`
*  `spring-cloud-starter-task`
* `spring-cloud-function-web`
** `FunctionalSpringApplication` is not supported
** `--enable-https` flag is required for HTTPS support.
* `spring-cloud-function-adapter-aws`
* `spring-cloud-starter-function-webflux`
** `--enable-https` flag is required for HTTPS support.
* `spring-cloud-starter-sleuth`

NOTE: Spring Cloud Bootstrap is no longer supported.

NOTE: While building a project that contains Spring Cloud Config Client, it is necessary to make sure that the configuration data source that it connects to (such as, Spring Cloud Config Server, Consul, Zookeeper, Vault, etc.) is available. For example, if you retrieve configuration data from Spring Cloud Config Server, make sure you have its instance running and available at the port indicated in the Config Client setup. This is necessary because the application context is being optimized at build time and requires the target environment to be resolved.

[[support-spring-data]]
=== Spring Data

[IMPORTANT]
====
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories.custom-implementations[Custom repository] implementation fragments need to be annotated with `@Component`.
