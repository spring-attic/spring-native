*Spring Native will be replaced late November 2022 by Spring Boot 3 official native support, see https://spring.io/blog/2022/09/26/native-support-in-spring-boot-3-0-0-m5[this blog post] for more details.*

Spring Native provides beta support for compiling Spring applications to native executables using https://www.graalvm.org[GraalVM]
https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/[native-image] compiler, in order to provide a native deployment
option typically designed to be packaged in lightweight containers.

== Quick start

The easiest way to start with Spring Native is probably to go to https://start.spring.io/[start.spring.io], add the Spring Native dependency, and read the {documentation-url}[reference documentation]. Make sure to configure properly the https://docs.spring.io/spring-native/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#spring-aot[Spring AOT Maven and Gradle plugins] that are mandatory to get proper native support for your Spring application.

=== Play with the samples

NOTE: You need to install the GraalVM `native-image` compiler, check {documentation-url}/#getting-started-native-image[the documentation] for more details.

- Download https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-native/tags[the latest release] of this repository.
- Go into the samples folder and pick one (e.g. `cd samples/commandlinerunner`)
- Run `./build.sh` which will run the regular JVM build, then a native image compilation, then test the result.

For more details on the samples see the {documentation-url}/index.html#samples[samples documentation].
