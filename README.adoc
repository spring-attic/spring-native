Spring Native provides an incubating support for compiling Spring applications to native executables using https://www.graalvm.org[GraalVM] 
https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/[native-image] compiler, in order to provide a native deployment
option designed to be packaged in lightweight containers. In practice, the target is to support your Spring application
(typically a Spring Boot one), unmodified, on this new platform.

It is mainly composed of:

- `spring-native`: this module contains the runtime dependency required for running Spring native like the substitutions.
- `spring-native-configuration`: this module contains configuration hints for Spring classes, including various Spring Boot auto-configurations.
- `spring-native-samples`: contains various samples that demonstrate the feature usage and are used as integration tests.
- `spring-native-docs`: contains the asciidoc documentation sources.
- `spring-native-tools`: tools used for reviewing image building configuration and output.
- `spring-aot`: this module contains the AOT transformation infrastructure common to Maven and Gradle plugins.
- `spring-aot-maven-plugin`: this module contains the Maven plugin that invokes AOT transformations.


It supports the {documentation-url}/reference/index.html#_spring_graalvm_native_options[following modes] using `-Dspring.native.mode=<mode>` on the `native-image` command line:

- `default` (activated out-of-the-box) provides resource, initialization, proxy, and reflection (using auto-configuration hints) configuration for native images.
- `init` (manually activated) should be used if only wishing to provide initialization configuration.
- `agent` (manually activated) is using the configuration generated by the tracing agent as a basis and also provides additional hints for components like controllers, etc.

== Scope and status

This project status is alpha, which means that we are currently mainly working on the software design and on supporting the features of the current samples (work in progress).
Supporting a wider range of Spring Boot applications, as well as optimizing efficiency (image size, memory consumption) and performances will happen as a second step.

Spring team collaborates with the GraalVM native team by raising issues in their bug tracker, to improve the production-readiness of native-images. These bugs on the GraalVM issue tracker https://github.com/oracle/graal/labels/spring[are identified by the `spring` label].

Some changes incubated here are moved directly to https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/labels/type%3A%20native[Spring Framework] and https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/labels/theme%3A%20native[Spring Boot] projects.

== Quick start

For detailed information and walkthroughs of applying the techniques to your project, please see the {documentation-url}/reference/index.html[documentation].

=== Artifacts

The latest {version} release supports GraalVM {graalvm-version} and Spring Boot {boot-version}.

- Artifact: https://repo.spring.io/{repository}/org/springframework/experimental/spring-graalvm-native/{version}/spring-graalvm-native-{version}.jar[`org.springframework.experimental:spring-graalvm-native:{version}`]
- Repository: https://repo.spring.io/{repository}[`https://repo.spring.io/{repository}`]

=== Play with the samples

- Download and extract https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-native/archive/{version}.zip[sources from the latest release].
- Go into the samples folder and pick one (e.g. `cd spring-native-samples/commandlinerunner`)
- Run `./build.sh` which will run a maven build, then a native image compile, then test the result.

`build.sh` runs the `compile.sh` script and in that compile script you can see the invocation of the `native-image` command. The other samples follow a similar model. For more details on the samples see the {documentation-url}/reference/index.html#samples[samples documentation].

== Contributing

This project is in the `spring-projects-experimental` org indicating it is not as mature as other Spring projects. Contributions are welcome (maybe read the {documentation-url}/reference/index.html#extension_guide[extension guide] if thinking about extending it to support your project). However, please recognize we aren't at the polishing javadoc stage and whilst pre 1.0 there may be heavy evolution of APIs.

=== Baseline

The development version on `master` is currently based on GraalVM {graalvm-dev-version} and Spring Boot {boot-dev-version}.
Mac, Linux and Windows are supported.
